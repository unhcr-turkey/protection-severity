# Compilation of protection severity index 

The protection severity index is calculated from multiple indicators.

The approach in this project is following the recommandations from the [OECD handbook](http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/42495745.pdf). [Training materials](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/coin2016trainingslidescointool.zip) were also provide by the [JRC-COIN].

the [Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards (COIN) of the  European Joint Research Center](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/coin).

In the humanitarian sector another example of composite indicator is the [INFORM â€“ humanitarian risk management index](http://www.inform-index.org/).
